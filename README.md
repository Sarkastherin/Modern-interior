## Overview

![screenshot](SS-moderInterior.png)

In this project, I used HTML, CSS and Javascript. Is a page with a responsive design, and in the mobile version its menu is hidden and is shown when a button is clicked. <br> When the menu is displayed fills the entire screen.
I enjoyed do this project. I practiced how I can organize the HTML content  in different screen sizes, also, learned more about responsive font-size and how I can used it in a same sheetstyle and screen (CSS). I coud played with de javascript file, I really enjoy doing code. This is a solution that I can reuse and it is now in my portafolio
